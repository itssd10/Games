# Games
Welcome to my Games Repository! This collection features various games I've created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project showcases different aspects of web development and game design, from a responsive Tic-Tac-Toe game with a sleek interface and score tracking, to a colorful and engaging Snake game. Additionally, you'll find a bubble popping game that tests your speed and precision. All games are designed to be mobile-responsive and visually appealing. Explore the code, play the games, and feel free to contribute or provide feedback. Happy gaming!
